This is A desktop application which is literally a really simpler version of Internet Download Manager.
Ofcourse it doesnt have the features of IDM and its only for downloading from URL, Even so im really proud cuz this was my first solo project with go which i was learning Golang itself along the way and it took me 10 days to do so.
I try to optimize it as much as i can and i did some test to see how much is the difference and it did fairly well.
there is an installer and installer script to so fill free to try it.
